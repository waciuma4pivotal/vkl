# vkl

Use your [github ssh keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) with ease!

## Installation
* Copy the script into your path.

## Dependencies
* [Lastpass-CLI](https://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli)
* Github ssh private key saved in a secure note in Lastpass `Productivity Tools` folder.
* .git-authors file present in home directory. File should be in [git-duet](https://github.com/git-duet/git-duet) format.
    
## Usage
Call vkl with the initials of the user and the number of hours you intend to use your ssh keys. If the user is not logged into lastpass on the command line, they will be prompted to login.

Example:
`vkl ww 3`

If it is before 6pm local time, omitting the number will autoset the key to expire at 6pm.

Example:
`vkl ww`

You may also provide the lastpass email instead of your initials.

Example:
`vkl mylastpass@email.com`
